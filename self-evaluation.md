- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Ruby arrays are essentially the same as in JavaScript, so I feel very confident with the content on arrays.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I would like to scroll through the array methods documentation and commit a few methods to memory. I don't want to have to bring up the Ruby documentation every time I want to check if an array includes a certain value, or when I want to add an element to the beginning of the array, etc.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
What are some methods I can use as a shortcut to iterating? For example, I could write the code below:
```
my_array = [];
for x in 0..10 do
  my_array.push(x)
end
```
Is there a quicker way to do something like this? JavaScript has methods like Array.map() and Array.reduce() but I am not sure about Ruby.
